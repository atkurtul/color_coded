goals
  ux
    easier to install (precompiled binaries + appimage)
    easier to configure (edn)
    direct llvm usage (rather than libclang)
    update llvm more easily (avoid portability issues)
    match tracing (no more incorrect highlighting when typing or scrolling)
  features
    support for neovim (remove lua? remove vim support?)
    easier to extend (multiple languages)
    lsp support
    better logging (:CCLog to open log file in new buffer)
    syntax highlighting supported in multiple windows at once
    better tests
    additional language support
      clojure
      rust
  performance
    entirely async, using tokio
    minimize allocations
    keep track of compilations per hash, to avoid duplicate compilations
